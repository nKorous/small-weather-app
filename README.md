# Notes

A small weather app to show the current weather for the selected area as well as the 3 day forecast for that area as well. Built for a code challenge. 

Technologies are an Angular 10 front end, Node.js/Express.js backend, and a MySQL database. A Working model can be found at [https://small-weather-app-op.herokuapp.com/](https://small-weather-app-op.herokuapp.com/). 

This uses the AccuWeather Limited Trial Weather API.
